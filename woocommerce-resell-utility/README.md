## Key Features

### 1. Market & Reseller Price Display
- **Regular Price** = `Market Price` (displayed cleanly in a lighter font with no strikethrough).
- **Sale Price** = `Reseller Price` (displayed prominently in bold).
- 100% non-destructive and tax-aware (`wc_price()`).
- Suppresses confusing "Save" / discount badges on Cart and Checkout pages.

### 2. Reseller Custom Selling Price ("আপনার বিক্রয়মূল্য লিখুন")
- Added right inside the single product page above the action buttons.
- Features dynamic live calculation of the reseller's estimated net profit:
  $$\text{Reseller Profit} = (\text{Customer Selling Price} - \text{Wholesale Price}) \times \text{Qty} - \text{Packaging Fee}$$
- Minimum price enforcement: Resellers cannot sell below wholesale cost.
- Automatically handles simple and variable products (recalculates on variation selection).

### 3. "Buy Now" (এখনই অর্ডার করুন) Buttons
- **Single Product Page:** Next to standard "Add to Cart", a high-contrast Buy Now button routes directly to checkout with the custom reseller price.
- **Shop & Archive Loops:** Buy Now button alongside Add to Cart with a sleek Quick Resell Modal popup for instant ordering without leaving the catalog.

### 4. Product Grid Card Alignment Fix
- Fixes the classic WooCommerce catalog issue where cards with varying title lengths cause misaligned prices and buttons.
- Normalized 2-line title clamp, `margin-top: auto` on price elements, and flexbox button rows ensure **every Add to Cart and Buy Now button is 100% horizontally aligned across all cards** in a clean 4-column desktop grid.

### 5. Packaging Cost (প্যাকেজিং খরচ) & Payout Accounting
- Store owners can set packaging fee (e.g. ৳20) in **WooCommerce -> Resell Utility**.
- Choice of **Per Order** or **Per Item** packaging fee deduction.
- Net reseller profit is automatically calculated and recorded in order metadata.

### 6. Dropshipping & Courier COD Order Meta (Steadfast / Pathao / RedX)

  - **এক ক্লিকে কুরিয়ার নোট কপি:** Formatted for instant paste into Steadfast / Pathao / RedX booking forms!

### 10. Reseller Ecosystem & Cashout Workflow
- **Custom Role:** Dedicated "রিসেলার" (`wru_reseller`) role restricting access to approved partners.
- **Admin Reseller Hub (`WooCommerce -> রিসেলার তালিকা ও ব্যালেন্স`):** Complete reseller directory, balances, order stats, and transaction history.
- **Editable Reseller Balance & Audit Ledger:** Store owners can manually credit bonuses or debit adjustments with full audit reasons recorded in an immutable ledger.
- **Reseller Cashout System:**
  - Reseller requests cashout from `/my-account/reseller-dashboard/`.
  - Request remains *Pending* with funds on hold.
  - Admin reviews and marks as *Paid* with Transaction ID (TrxID) or rejects with reason.
  - Funds are permanently deducted upon completion.
- **Reseller Company Name on Packaging Labels:**
  - Invoices and parcel box labels display the **Reseller's Company / Shop Name** and hotline as the sender, ensuring wholesale supplier anonymity (never outputs wholesale store name).
  - Admins can print or download the packaging slip in one click directly from the Order Details page.

## Data Persistence & Long-Term Architecture Guarantee

- **100% Native Architecture:** All plugin data is stored using official WordPress and WooCommerce data structures (`wp_posts`, `wp_postmeta`, `wp_usermeta`, `wp_options`, `wp_wc_orders_meta`). No unstable or non-standard custom tables are created.
- **Safe from Deactivation & Deletion:** Deactivating, disabling, or deleting the plugin **never drops or destroys** historical reseller earnings, order collection data, balance ledgers, or cashout history.
- **Reinstall & Reload:** If the plugin is removed and re-installed in the future, all data immediately and automatically re-syncs and displays without data loss.
- **Backup & Migration Ready:** Because standard tables are used, all data is automatically captured by standard WordPress backup tools (UpdraftPlus, Duplicator, All-in-One WP Migration, and standard mysqldump).
